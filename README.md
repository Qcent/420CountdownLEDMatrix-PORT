# 420 Countdown Timer

## Description
A port of a program originally written for an ESP32 powered LED matrix display. Using the power of Python3 and
multicore PC architecture, I have painstakingly brute forced the Emulated experience of Adafruit_Matrix and FastLED
backed animated LED scrolling display. Entertain friends and family alike as you count down to the golden 'hour'. \
ðŸŒ¿ Happy 420 ðŸŒ¿

Works on Windows, macOS, and probably Linuxes too. I'll test it on one of those someday.

## Fun Facts
1. Ants take rest for around 8 Minutes in 12-hour period.
2. A cloud weighs around a million tonnes.
3. Starfish donâ€™t have bodies. They are technically classed as heads.
4. Pressing Alt-T will allow you to set the hour and minute of the next countdown end, as well as the countdown messages.
5. This project was inspired by the creation of my [PROGMEM image editor tool](https://github.com/Qcent/LEDMatrixImageEditor), that I used to tune the images used in the original Arduino code.
